In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. There might a lot of resources out in the web to determine if a string is palindrome using Javasript, C#, Java and other programming languages. I took a step-back and thought of sharing the code in Apex to help.

F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>

The sequence starts:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144....
